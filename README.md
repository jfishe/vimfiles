Windows Vim 8 configuration files based on the recommendations of [Ruslan Osipov](http://www.rosipov.com/blog/vim-pathogen-and-git-submodules/) and [Keep Your vimrc file clean](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_your_vimrc_file_clean).

vimsub.sh semi-automates adding bundles as git submodules because my list was getting a little long.
